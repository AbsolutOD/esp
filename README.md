	<strong>ESP is a small tool for using SSM Parameters as Environment Variables</strong>
</p>

## Overview

This is a small utility for using AWS SSM Parameters as Environment Variables - which can be useful in containerized environments such as Kubernetes.

See the [example config file](https://github.com/pinpt/esp/blob/master/espfile.sample.json) for how you could map SSM parameters to environment variables for use with the CLI.
